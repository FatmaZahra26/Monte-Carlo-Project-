# Monte Carlo Project: Develop of a truncated normal distribution and testing preferential sampling method for different distributions.


👋 Hello there! This Monte Carlo project was developed using R programming language 📊📈.

The main goal of the project was to develop a truncated normal distribution and test the preferential sampling method for different distributions. 📉📊

To accomplish this, we implemented various statistical techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations, hypothesis testing, and statistical modeling. 📈🔬

The project involved several steps, including data preparation, model development, testing and validation, and visualization of the results. 📊📉🔍👀

The final results showed that the preferential sampling method was effective for different distributions, and the truncated normal distribution proved to be a useful tool for modeling real-world phenomena. 🙌👍

Overall, this project provided valuable insights into the practical applications of statistical methods, and demonstrated the power of R as a tool for data analysis and modeling. 💻🔬👨‍🔬
